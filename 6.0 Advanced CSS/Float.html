        <p>Raul Alfonso Tejada[1] is a ghoul mechanic and former gunslinger from Mexico City, now residing as a prisoner of the State of Utobitha at Black Mountain in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas. He is a possible companion of the Courier.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Born in 2047,[2] Raul Tejada has a long and storied history. Before the war, he lived at Hidalgo Ranch owned by his family outside Mexico City where he developed skill in using both firearms and mechanic tools, both of which occasionally got him in trouble with the law, although Raul's close family ties mostly kept him in line. When not practicing with his guns or helping maintain or repair machines, he consumed tabloid magazines like El Peri√≥dico de las Aburridas reporting on events like a scandalous story about a starlet who dated American businessman Robert House.</p>

            <p>Invigorated by his travels with the Courier, Raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost Rafaela. Soon after, the Mojave was filled with tales of the ghost-vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak</p>

            <p class="p-right">Convinced that his time as a gunslinger was past, Raul made peace with the idea of growing old. After traveling with the Courier for a time, he retired and settled down in Outer Vegas, where he would spend his days fixing ancient machinery.</p>
